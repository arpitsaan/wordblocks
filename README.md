## Gameplay
The goal of playing Word Blocks is to make the highest score possible. 
The more you score, the more you learn the language.

As soon as you start the game, you will see a word block from the Spanish language at the bottom of your screen. An English word block will fall from the top, you have to answer if these words mean the SAME ‚úÖ or NOT ‚ùå

For every correct answer, you get +1üôå in your score. 

üëâThe gravity in the scene increases with every correct answer, so it becomes difficult over time!

For every incorrect answer, you lose a life -‚ù§Ô∏è. 

The game starts with you having 3 lives, the game ends when you lose all lives.
